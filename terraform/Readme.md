### 🌍 Introduction to Terraform

**Terraform** is an open-source **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by **HashiCorp**. It enables you to **define, provision, and manage infrastructure** using a high-level configuration language called **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)** or optionally **JSON**.

### 🔧 What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code allows you to **automate the management of your infrastructure** (e.g., servers, networks, databases) through code, rather than manual processes.

Benefits of IaC:

* **Version control**
* **Repeatability**
* **Consistency**
* **Scalability**

### 🧱 Key Features of Terraform

* **Platform Agnostic:** Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and many more through **providers**.
* **Declarative Language:** You describe **what** you want, and Terraform figures out **how** to achieve it.
* **State Management:** Maintains a **state file** to track infrastructure resources.
* **Execution Plan:** Provides a **preview of changes** before applying them.
* **Modular:** Supports **reusable modules** for better organization.

### 📁 Basic Terraform Workflow

1. **Write** configuration in `.tf` files (e.g., define an EC2 instance).
2. **Initialize** with `terraform init` (downloads necessary provider plugins).
3. **Plan** changes with `terraform plan` (shows what will happen).
4. **Apply** with `terraform apply` (makes changes).
5. **Destroy** with `terraform destroy` (removes resources).

### 📝 Example: Basic EC2 Instance on AWS

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

* Automating CI/CD environments
* Multi-cloud deployments

---

### ✅ Why Use Terraform?

* **Open-source and community-supported**
* **Multi-cloud support**
* **Automation-ready**
* **Safe and predictable**
