### 🌍 Introduction to Terraform

**Terraform** is an open-source **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by **HashiCorp**. It enables you to **define, provision, and manage infrastructure** using a high-level configuration language called **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)** or optionally **JSON**.

---

### 🔧 What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code allows you to **automate the management of your infrastructure** (e.g., servers, networks, databases) through code, rather than manual processes.

Benefits of IaC:

* **Version control**
* **Repeatability**
* **Consistency**
* **Scalability**

### 🧱 Key Features of Terraform

* **Platform Agnostic:** Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and many more through **providers**.
* **Declarative Language:** You describe **what** you want, and Terraform figures out **how** to achieve it.
* **State Management:** Maintains a **state file** to track infrastructure resources.
* **Execution Plan:** Provides a **preview of changes** before applying them.
* **Modular:** Supports **reusable modules** for better organization.

---

### 📁 Basic Terraform Workflow

1. **Write** configuration in `.tf` files (e.g., define an EC2 instance).
2. **Initialize** with `terraform init` (downloads necessary provider plugins).
3. **Plan** changes with `terraform plan` (shows what will happen).
4. **Apply** with `terraform apply` (makes changes).
5. **Destroy** with `terraform destroy` (removes resources).

---

### 📝 Example: Basic EC2 Instance on AWS

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

---

### 📚 Use Cases

* Provisioning cloud infrastructure
* Setting up Kubernetes clusters
* Automating CI/CD environments
* Multi-cloud deployments

---

### ✅ Why Use Terraform?

* **Open-source and community-supported**
* **Multi-cloud support**
* **Automation-ready**
* **Safe and predictable**

### 🌱 Terraform Basics: Configuration Files, Providers, and Resources

To get started with Terraform, you need to understand its **core components**:

---

## 1️⃣ Configuration Files (`.tf` files)

Terraform uses **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**, which is declarative. These `.tf` files define **what infrastructure you want** (not how to create it).

**Structure:**

* `.tf` files contain blocks like `provider`, `resource`, `variable`, and `output`.

📄 **Example:**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

---

## 2️⃣ Providers

**Providers** are plugins that Terraform uses to manage resources on specific platforms (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).

🧩 **Purpose:**

* Act as an API interface to the cloud platform or service.
* Must be declared in your configuration.

📄 **Example:**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

✅ Other examples:

* `provider "azurerm"` (for Azure)
* `provider "google"` (for GCP)
* `provider "kubernetes"`

---

## 3️⃣ Resources

**Resources** are the **core building blocks** of Terraform. They represent actual components (like VMs, networks, databases, etc.) in your infrastructure.

🧱 **Syntax:**

```hcl
resource "<PROVIDER>_<TYPE>" "<NAME>" {
  # Configuration arguments
}
```

📄 **Example:**

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-bucket-123"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

🌟 Terraform tracks each resource using the resource's name and its **state**.

---

## 🧪 Example in Context

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "MyWebServer"
  }
}
```

This code:

* Sets up AWS as the provider.
* Launches a small EC2 instance.
* Tags it as "MyWebServer".

---

## ✅ Recap

| Component     | Purpose                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Configuration | Files written in HCL that define the setup |
| Provider      | Specifies the platform (AWS, Azure, etc.)  |
| Resource      | Describes infrastructure to be created     |
